                            <p><i>Signs & Wonders</i> is a tabletop roleplaying game where players utilize a tarot deck to imagine the events leading up to a cataclysm of their invention. The game begins with deciding what the inevitable catastrophe is, & then players spend the next 1-2 hours interpreting the signals & portents which lead up to the end of everything.</p>

            <p><b>Lessons learned:</b></p>
            <ul class="lessons">
                <li>Players who are already familiar with tarot cards are easily-engaged by the act of interpreting a sequence of cards into a narrative. We were able to leverage this to create a game which many non-gamers can easily pick up due to their already-extent associations with a tarot deck.</li>
                <li>Sacrificing brevity for clarity is always worth it. Playtesting a game with such a focused demographic can be difficult. Ultimately, our playtesting-base was wide enough that we had to write a section of the rules clarifying what the act of interpretation even is. </li>
            </ul>
