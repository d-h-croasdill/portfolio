            <p><i>dumpling.love</i> is an award-winning, liveops web-venture game originally built as an experiment in non-hierarchical development practices. It has since sprawled out into an internet park, using a set of homecooked JS tools to allow visitors to explore the space & play with a variety of friends & toys.</p>

            <p><b>Lessons learned:</b></p>
            <ul class="lessons">
                <li>Preserving & elevating each team member's creative voice is a powerful design modality. We built an exciting & award-winning game by acknowledging that each team member can & should influence the design of the game. This style of collaboration is capable of creating objects which are magnitudes more complicated than an individual could ever do on their own.</li>
                <li>Communication across fields is always worth struggle for. My teammates on this game are largely engineers & technical artists, we had to take a semi-agile bend to our process so that we could keep up with each other. Consequently, I learned more about the actual process of building & maintaining a website than I ever thought I would be able to.</li>
