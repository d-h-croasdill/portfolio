                        <p>During the pandemic, a few colleagues & I got together to make a game which was supposed to be played over Zoom. The resulting game was <i>Under Advisement</i>, which is a light roleplaying game for 4-6 players. Players take on one of several roles-- the King, the Knight, or the Advisors. The King is trying to make policy decisions for their country, the Advisors are all trying to push their agendas through Zoom's chat feature (which the King can't see), & the Knight has to be the bridge between them.</p>
