                <a href="/games/aporias.html" target="_blank"><i>Aporias</i></a> is a tabletop roleplaying system & supplement, featuring 120+ pages of adventure, hijinks, & story prompts across 4 booklets. Completed as my thesis project for the MFA program at the NYU Game Center, it's a blend of technical & fiction writing. I took a more playful approach to the rules writing, which worked well to incentivize more engaged reading on the player's part.

                <p><a href="/games/signsandwonders.html" target="_blank"><i>Signs & Wonders</i></a> is a tarot-based roleplaying game for 2 or more players. Using tarot cards, players assemble the story of an on-coming cataclysm & all of the events which preceded it. There were a number of challenges in this design, but perhaps the biggest one was finding ways to describe the action of interpreting a tarot card. My collaborator & I settled on including a section of the book which described "interpretive work."</p>

                        <a href="/games/barks.html"><i>In space, no one can hear you bark</i></a> is a branching-narrative sci-fi game which is largely composed out of barks (short snippets of dialog spoken by videogame characters which give the player orientation & information about the world around them). As a narrative designer on the project, I wrote barks, managed the overall structure of the game, & edited writing done by my colleagues to ensure consistency in each character's voice across the game.

                        <br><br>
                        The game consisted of a UI built in Unity, which displayed a couple dozen bark sheets in an order determined by player input. On the first image below, each sticky note is a single bark sheet.

                <br><br>
                <span class="sub-label" style="font-size:.9em">"In typical FromSoftware fashion, items in Bloodborne are accompanied by a short description which often barely explains to the player how & why the item functions. It is precisely because of this reticence, this apparent shyness of the game’s narrative, that these objects can be read as symptoms of Yharnam’s history. These tools are each monuments to trauma— by voluntarily taking up these monuments, the player is able to imagine herself as a participant in trauma (her foes’ or her own)."</span>

                    <a href="/games/lastnovember.html" target="_blank"><i>last november i totally fucking freaked out</i></a> is an interactive poetry collection which allows a reader to create erasure poems from almost any chunk of text in the game. By clicking on a particular word, a reader may toggle that word on or off, effectively "erasing" it to create new poems. A reader can also interact with the erased words by hovering their mouse over the page, creating a rosy, ghostly impression of the word.
