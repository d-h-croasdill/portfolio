    <p>I used the game as a way of exploring a few theoretical problems I had come up against when just starting out in game design. You can click the following bullet points to learn more about two of these problems.</p>
    <details>
        <summary>How can losing be fun?</summary>
        <p>What is the function of a loss? The western sense of competition can be observed in <b>history</b> (the ancient Greek notion of <i>arete</i>, glory in competition), <b>theory</b> (Smith's invisible hand), & <b>practice</b> (look no further than the cultures which arise around sports) as a fulcrum for establishing moral judgments. A victor is ordained as morally superior, essentially correct, & a loser is just that. A loser, a bum, something worth less.</p>

    <p>But the frivolousness of play allows us to mirthfully experiment with what dialect to winner & loser are producing. It needn't always be so dire. In <i>Checkers 2</i>, I experimented with building a game in such a way that the winner & loser are not in Hegel's fight to the death, producing the master-slave dialectic, but rather in a mutually enjoyable entanglement, producing a queered top-bottom dialectic.</p>

    <p>In <i>Checkers 2</i>, the only textual consequence of losing is that your character won't take the lead in their flirting scenario. Which, I am lead to believe, is a preferable position for many people. I've watched numerous players elect to lose the game, because it creates the personal narrative which is most to their taste.</p>

        <summary>How can a game be queer?</summary>
        <p>When I was making <i>Checkers 2</i>, it didn't seem enough to call the game queer just because it was about queer people, or made by a queer person. Something about the <i>essential procedures</i> of the game had to be making an argument about queerness. & not queer in that silly academic sense, where it's about as complicated & theoretical a concept as modernism.</p>

        <p>What goes into making a game about the vulgar, for-real, anecdotal experience of being a homosexual? Moreover, how do you keep it from drifting into becoming the trauma-porn of a Serious Game? These are theoretical questions with a pleasurably practical answerâ€” keep it horny.</p>

        <p>To be horny on a formal level is to build your rules in such a way that players have to be taking horny actions. If there's one thing to be learned from the current breadth of queer identities, it's that sexuality cannot effectively be universalized. Ultimately, <i>Checkers 2</i> exposes more about my own relationship to queerness than anything about queerness overall.</p>

        <p>It is worth noting that despite these particularities of the rules, once the game gets into the hands of other players, they tend to have a blast projecting their own particularities. </p>
