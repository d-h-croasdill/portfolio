    <p><span class="big">There is, perennially, some discussion in my social spheres about user experience (UX) in videogames.</span><br><br>

    Particularly, what constitutes "good" or "bad" UX design. The context for this round of discussions isn't especially important. I don't even know who Elton Ring is. But each time the discussions come up, I bristle a bit at the uncritical & unspecific invocation of "good" UX design. Coming at this from the designer's side, "good" UX is ridiculous at best & unethical at worst.</p>

    <p>To summarize the field as I've encountered it, UX aims to create & measure feelings engendered by a particular interface. It's a fascinating progression from the fields of human-computer interactions (HCI) & user interfaces (UI), rooted firmly in both behavioral psychology & marketing. It's bizarre & exciting to wonder about not just what a button in a menu looks like, but what it <i>feels like to press that button.</i> What an amazing opportunity to create expressive, playful, or even rhetorical clicks, right?</p>

    <This>Unfortunately, the canonical experiences which UX aims to create are frictionless, habitual, & only-ever pleasant-- homogenous, by any other name. In my time navigating a design education, UX design has never been taught to me as a creative field about imagining new ways to interact with a device. It is always pitched as a set of best practices for catching & holding advantage over a user.
        
    <p>This is probably due to the field arising as a series of commercial processes. A product has to be as easy to use as possible, & all the better if it's so easy to use that the desire to use it displaces some other, more difficult-to-fulfill desires. Typically these more difficult desires are the desires to use other products. But surely you can imagine how this goal could also be leveraged by say, social media, gambling, or game designers to create products which target discontented people (<i>i.e.,</i> everyone that there is) with offers of escapism.</p>

    <p>& you would imagine correctly! Nice one. Anecdotally, I've heard the term "habit-forming" said like it's a positive thing by a few UI/UX teachers, & I've had the unnerving experience of reading Nir Eyal's collection of UX case studies <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/hooked/" target="_blank"><i>Hooked: How to Build Habit-forming Products</i></a>. Eyal's book begins with a 14-page caveat about the non-difference between the terms "habit-forming" & "addictive," but comes in with the reassurance that: <br>
        <div style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-size:1.4em">"... this book teaches innovators how to build products to help people do the things they already want to do but, for lack of a solution, don't do." (12)</div><br>
    It's all for the social good. Despite himself, Eyal writes seven pages later:<br><br>
        <div style="padding-left:40px;padding-right:40px;font-size:1.4em">"... fostering consumer habits is an effective way to increase the value of a company by driving higher customer-lifetime value (CLTV): the amount of money made from a customer before that person switches to a competitor, stops using the product, or dies." (19)</div>
    </p>
    <p><i>Fuck, man!</i> Christ. Come on.</p>

    <p>This is an inversion from the manifesto of early HCI designers like Alan Kay working at Xerox PARC in the 1970s. Kay & his colleagues had aimed to use habits which users already had in order to build graphical user interface (GUI) metaphors. The operating system's "desktop," "windows," & "pages" were meant to be metaphors for their real-world counterparts. These metaphors were supposed to act like handholds to enable a computer user with no knowledge of the underlying hardware perform complex tasks such as navigating/organizing a hard drive or creating rich text documents. Kay's general mode of imagining HCI was influenced by constructivist pedagogy, he & his colleagues' explicit mission was <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now" target="_blank">the education & empowerment of the computer operator</a>.</p>

    <p>In the 50 years since this early work, the position of the computer in the western imagination has switched. The computer is no longer just a tool or an aid, it is largely a site of consumption. Which is like, whatever, I happen to really enjoy watching an endless stream of content & not doing anything & actually I wish I was doing that right now. But it's a far cry from the digital dream of the late-century Californian-utopians.</p>
